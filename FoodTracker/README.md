# Food Tracker

A full-stack nutrition tracking application that runs as a **Windows desktop app** or web application. Track your daily caloric intake, macronutrients, and meal history with an intuitive visual interface - all running completely offline on your computer.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Want the Desktop App? (.exe)
**See [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md)** for step-by-step instructions to build a Windows executable.

### Want to Run as Web App?
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
cd server
npm start

# Terminal 2: Start frontend  
npm run dev
```

## Overview

Food Tracker is a comprehensive nutrition management system that allows users to:
- Track daily food consumption with detailed nutritional breakdowns
- Visualize caloric and macronutrient data through interactive donut charts
- Manage a custom food library with nutritional information
- **Run as a native Windows desktop application**
- **Store all data locally (no internet required)**
- View historical data and analytics across multiple days
- Configure personalized caloric and macro goals

## Key Learnings

### State Management at Scale
- Mastered **React's useState and useEffect** hooks to manage complex, interconnected state across multiple tabs
- Implemented **prop drilling** and learned when component state should be lifted vs. kept local
- Handled real-time updates between frontend state and backend data persistence

### Full-Stack Data Flow
- Built a complete **RESTful API** with Express.js handling CRUD operations for food entries
- Learned to structure **modular backend code** with separate files for data management, calculations, and routes
- Implemented custom **nutrient calculation logic** to aggregate macros and calories from food entries

### UI/UX Design
- Created **responsive tab-based navigation** for organizing complex functionality
- Designed **interactive data visualizations** using donut charts to make nutritional data intuitive
- Implemented **form validation** and user feedback for food entry and goal setting

### Data Persistence Challenges
- Developed a **daily reset system** that archives previous day's data automatically
- Managed **historical records** with proper date tracking and retrieval
- Built a **food library system** allowing users to save and reuse common foods

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React** - Component-based UI with hooks for state management
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Modern syntax and async operations
- **CSS3** - Custom styling with flexbox and grid layouts
- **Fetch API** - Asynchronous communication with backend

### Backend
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime for server-side code
- **Express.js** - Web framework for API routing and middleware
- **File System (fs)** - Data persistence using JSON files
- **CORS** - Cross-origin resource sharing middleware

### Tools & Libraries
- **Vite** - Fast development build tool
- **npm** - Package management
- **Nodemon** - Auto-restart server during development

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Create WebApp for downloadable user experience
- [ ] Create mobile-responsive design for on-the-go tracking
- [ ] Integrate with nutritional local models to allow the user to use the app fully locally
- [ ] Deploy downloadable link to production

## 📦 Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]

# Navigate to FoodTracker directory
cd FoodTracker

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Start the backend server (from server directory)
npm start

# In a new terminal, start the frontend (from FoodTracker root)
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (frontend) and the API at `http://localhost:3001`.
